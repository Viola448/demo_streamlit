Using a Streamlit dashboard, I analyze various statistics like attack attempts, kills, blocks, digs, and overall team performance to determine efficiency, success percentage, and overall game outcomes. NCAA Women's Volleyball revolves around an attack-defense system upon which kills depend upon defense plays like blocks and digs. Kill-to-attack ratio for 2022-2023 averages 22%-27%, meaning approximately one in four or five attempts that kill. It varies with team play and opposition defense. Performance measurement, winning strategies, and factors leading to success are highlighted using visualizations since between teams they are compared and tracking patterns.")

Lower rated teams in terms of block percentage success may take some time working on block skillsâ€”improved timing and positioning could place them more solidly in charge at the net.")
